# 🔄 Project Workflow

1. The user enters loan applicant details.
2. Flask validates the submitted information.
3. Input data is transformed using the saved label encoders.
4. The trained XGBoost model predicts the loan status.
5. The system displays:
   - Loan Approved or Loan Rejected
   - Approval Confidence (%)
   - Rejection Risk (%)

---

# 📊 Machine Learning Model

The Smart Lender application uses an **XGBoost Classifier** trained on historical loan application data.

### Data Preprocessing

- Missing value handling
- Label Encoding
- Feature transformation
- Model training using XGBoost
- Model serialization using Joblib

Saved model files:

- `xgboost_model.pkl`
- `label_encoders.pkl`

These files are loaded by the Flask application during prediction.

---

# 📋 Input Features

- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self Employed
- Applicant Income
- Co-Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount Term
- Credit History
- Property Area

---

# 📈 Prediction Output

After prediction, the application displays:

- ✅ Loan Approved
- ❌ Loan Rejected
- 📈 Approval Confidence (%)
- 📉 Rejection Risk (%)

The confidence values help users understand the certainty of the model's prediction.
